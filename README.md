# UOregon CS 211
This repository includes some of the labs and projects from University of Oregon CS 211.
This is meant to show my progress in Python programming.
If you are taking CS 211, please not copy any of the code in this repository as a means to complete your own assignments.

## Credits
Most of the course material is created by Professor Michal Young from the University of Oregon.
Edits to the code for the purposes of completing the assignments belong to me.

Many project directories have their own LICENSE files including some version of the Creative Commons Legal Code, Creative Commons Attribution, or GNU General Public License.
For pieces of code without a specified license, assume Creative Commons Attribution.

Beyond what is found in those licenses, I kindly ask that you do not copy any of the code in this repository as a means to complete your own assignments.
Your syllabus likely doesn't allow that, and you should be writing your own code if you plan to learn Computer Science anyway. Thanks.
